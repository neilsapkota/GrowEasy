): Promise<PlacementTestResult> => {
    const prompt = `A user has completed a placement test in ${language.name}. Here is their performance history: ${JSON.stringify(history)}.
Based on this, what is their proficiency level?
Determine which of the following topics they can skip. The available topics correspond to different levels:
- A1 Level: 'greetings', 'family'
- A2 Level: 'food', 'hobbies'
- B1 Level: 'travel', 'work', 'shopping', 'directions'
- B2 Level: 'weather', 'home', 'health', 'emotions'
- C1 Level: 'school', 'tech', 'culture', 'nature'
- C2 Level: 'past', 'future'

A user who answers mostly A1 questions correctly should skip 'greetings' and 'family'. A user who also answers A2 questions correctly can skip the first four topics, and so on. If they struggle with A1 questions, they should skip nothing.

Return your evaluation as a JSON object with 'completedTopics' (an array of topic IDs to skip) and a 'summary' (a brief, encouraging sentence about their level, e.g., "You've got a great handle on the basics!").`;

    Based on their performance in the conversation (grammar, vocabulary, fluency), what is their proficiency level?
    Determine which of the following topics they can skip. The available topics correspond to different levels:
    - A1 Level (Beginner): 'greetings', 'family'
    - A2 Level (Elementary): 'food', 'hobbies'
    - If they struggled with basic greetings, they should skip nothing (return an empty array for 'completedTopics').
    - If they handled greetings and introductions well, they can skip 'greetings' and 'family'.
    - If they showed a broader vocabulary and could form slightly more complex sentences (e.g., about food or hobbies), they can also skip 'food' and 'hobbies'.
    
    Be conservative. This is for beginners, so only mark the most basic topics as completed if they showed clear mastery.
